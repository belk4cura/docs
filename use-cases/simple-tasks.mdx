Simple Tasks automate basic, focused jobs described in a single instruction set. Ideal for straightforward goals like "Do this one specific thing," even if it involves visiting a web page or two, without complex multi-step logic.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Single Goal:** Aims to achieve one primary objective (e.g., log in, find a specific piece of information, do a quick search, check a status).
*   **Single Instruction Set:** You give the agent all the directions for the job at once.
*   **Direct Action:** The agent follows your instructions from start to finish for that specific task.

**When to Use Simple Tasks:**

Simple Tasks are great for common, everyday web actions like:

*   Logging you into websites or online tools.
*   Navigating to a specific page to retrieve a well-defined piece of information (like a price, status, or account balance).
*   Doing basic web searches and pulling out simple results (like page titles).
*   Filling out very short, simple forms.
*   Checking the status of something (like an order) on a single page.
*   Comparing straightforward information (like prices) across a *pre-defined* list of specific pages opened simultaneously.

5.  **Comparing Prices (Specific Pages):**
    *   *Goal:* Compare a product's price on two specific websites.
