Simple Tasks are the most basic type of automation you can ask Cura to perform. They are perfect for handling **focused, self-contained jobs** that you can describe in a single instruction set.

Think of telling the agent: "Do this one specific thing." Even if that requires visiting a web page or two, the overall goal is straightforward and doesn't need to be broken down into multiple complicated steps.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Single Goal:** Aims to achieve one primary objective (e.g., log in, find a specific piece of information, do a quick search, check a status).
*   **Single Instruction Set:** You give the agent all the directions for the job at once.
*   **Direct Action:** The agent follows your instructions from start to finish for that specific task.

**When to Use Simple Tasks:**

Simple Tasks are great for common, everyday web actions like:

*   Logging you into websites or online tools.
*   Navigating to a specific page to retrieve a well-defined piece of information (like a price, status, or account balance).
*   Doing basic web searches and pulling out simple results (like page titles).
*   Filling out very short, simple forms.
*   Checking the status of something (like an order) on a single page.
*   Comparing straightforward information (like prices) across a *pre-defined* list of specific pages opened simultaneously.

### Examples of Simple Tasks (Conceptual)

Here are some scenarios best suited for Simple Tasks:

1.  **Website Login:**
    *   *Goal:* Get logged into your company's CRM.
    *   *Instruction:* "Log me into `https://app.mycrm.com` with username 'alex.chen' and my saved password, then go to the main dashboard."

2.  **Quick Web Search:**
    *   *Goal:* Find recent news headlines.
    *   *Instruction:* "Search Google News for 'latest space exploration news' and tell me the titles of the first three articles."

3.  **Finding Specific Info:**
    *   *Goal:* Check a stock price.
    *   *Instruction:* "Go to `https://finance.example.com/quote/XYZ` and tell me the current stock price."

4.  **Checking a Status:**
    *   *Goal:* See where your online order is.
    *   *Instruction:* "Go to `https://shippingtracker.com/track`, enter tracking ID 'ABC123XYZ', and tell me the latest shipping status."

5.  **Comparing Prices (Specific Pages):**
    *   *Goal:* Compare a product's price on two specific websites.
    *   *Instruction:* "Open `https://competitorA.com/product/widget` and `https://competitorB.com/widget`. Find the price for the 'Super Widget' on both pages and tell me what they are."

These examples show how Simple Tasks help automate common, specific actions quickly and easily.

### Distinction from Other Use Cases

Simple Tasks differ from more complex scenarios handled by other Curalabs capabilities:

*   **Complex Data Entry:** Simple tasks usually involve minimal typing or form filling. For filling out long forms, applications, or processes that need validation, see [Complex Data Entry](/use-cases/data-entry).
*   **Deep Research:** Simple Tasks grab specific facts you ask for. They don't browse broadly, piece together information from many places, or write summaries. For more in-depth research, see [Deep Research](/use-cases/deep-research).
*   **Report Generation:** A Simple Task might find a number for a report, but it won't create the whole report. See [Report Generation](/use-cases/report-generation).
*   **Multi-Step Workflows:** Simple Tasks are one-off jobs. If your process has several distinct stages, needs decisions made along the way, or involves moving information between different sites or systems, you'd use a [Workflow](/platform/using-workflows).
