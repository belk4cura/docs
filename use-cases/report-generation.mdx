"Report Generation" with Cura automates the **data gathering and consolidation** needed for reports, collecting required data points from various online sources. While not creating the final formatted document, Cura saves the tedious work of manual data collection.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Automated Data Collection:** Cura navigates specified websites or sources to find and extract the specific data points needed for a report.
*   **Multi-Source Gathering:** Can pull information from various places like web pages, internal dashboards (if accessible via browser), or even uploaded documents.
*   **Data Consolidation:** Presents the gathered information in a structured way (e.g., as a list, text summary, or potentially extracted values) that you can then easily use in your actual report document.
*   **Scheduled Runs (Potential):** Can be set up (often via Workflows) to gather report data regularly (e.g., weekly sales numbers, daily social media mentions).

**When to Use Cura for Report Generation:**

Leverage Cura to streamline the data collection phase for reports like:

*   Compiling weekly sales figures from different product dashboards.
*   Gathering monthly competitor pricing information from their websites.
*   Collecting key performance indicators (KPIs) from various internal web-based tools.
*   Aggregating customer feedback or mentions from specific online sources.
*   Pulling together data for financial summaries from online banking or investment portals.

### Examples of Report Generation Support (Conceptual)

Hereâ€™s how Cura can help gather data for your reports:

1.  **Weekly Sales Data Collection:**
    *   *Goal:* Gather key sales metrics for a weekly report.
    *   *Instruction:* "Go to the Sales Dashboard URL, log in, navigate to the 'Weekly Summary' section, and extract the 'Total Revenue', 'New Customers', and 'Top Selling Product' for the past week."
    *   *Action:* Cura logs in, finds the specified data points on the dashboard, and provides them to you, ready to be plugged into your report template.

2.  **Competitor Price Monitoring Report:**
    *   *Goal:* Collect current prices for specific competitor products for a monthly report.
    *   *Instruction:* "Visit the product pages for 'Widget Pro' on Competitor A's site, Competitor B's site, and Competitor C's site. Extract the current price from each page." (This could be a recurring task).
    *   *Action:* Cura performs the [Multi-Site Interaction](/use-cases/multi-site) to gather the prices, presenting them in a list for easy inclusion in your pricing analysis report.

3.  **KPI Aggregation:**
    *   *Goal:* Collect website traffic and lead generation numbers for a marketing report.
    *   *Instruction:* "Log into the Analytics Dashboard, find the 'Unique Visitors' for the last 7 days. Then, log into the CRM Dashboard, find the 'New Leads Created' for the last 7 days. Report both numbers."
    *   *Action:* Cura navigates both dashboards, extracts the specific KPIs, and provides the consolidated figures.

These examples highlight how Cura automates the often time-consuming data retrieval step, allowing you to focus on analyzing the information and creating the final report presentation.
