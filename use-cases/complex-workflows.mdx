"Complex Workflows" combine different automation types into multi-step sequences, managed via the [Workflow](/platform/using-workflows) features. Cura executes these sequences (e.g., read doc, login, enter data, check site, notify) to automate entire processes, rather than just single actions.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Multi-Step Processes:** Chains together several distinct actions or tasks in a defined order.
*   **Combines Capabilities:** Mixes and matches different use cases (like reading documents, entering data, interacting across sites) within a single automation.
*   **End-to-End Automation:** Can handle complete business processes rather than just isolated steps.
*   **Conditional Logic (Potential):** Advanced workflows might even involve making decisions based on information found in earlier steps (though we'll keep the examples conceptual here).
*   **Orchestration:** Cura manages the flow, context, and data handoffs between the different steps.

**When to Use Complex Workflows:**

Leverage Complex Workflows when you need to automate processes that:

*   Involve multiple distinct stages or decision points.
*   Require interaction with several different web applications or data sources (documents, websites).
*   Follow a standard operating procedure with sequential steps.
*   Need to pass information gathered in one step to a subsequent step.

### Example of a Complex Workflow (Conceptual)

Let's illustrate with an end-to-end sales order processing example:

*   **Goal:** Process an incoming purchase order (PO) PDF attached to an email, check inventory, and create a draft sales order in the CRM.

*   **Workflow Steps:**

    1.  **Monitor & Trigger:** (Assumes an initial trigger, like receiving an email)
    2.  **Extract PO Details (`From Document`):**
        *   *Instruction:* "Read the attached purchase order PDF `[PO PDF ID]`. Extract the Customer Name, PO Number, Item Code(s), and Quantity for each item."
        *   *Action:* Cura reads the PDF and extracts the key data.
    3.  **Check Inventory (`Multi-Site Interaction` / `Simple Task`):**
        *   *Instruction:* "Log into the Inventory Management System at `[Inventory System URL]`. For each Item Code extracted from the PO, check the 'Available Stock' quantity."
        *   *Action:* Cura logs in and performs the stock lookups.
    4.  **Decision Point (Conceptual):** (The workflow engine might check if stock is sufficient based on Step 3's findings). Let's assume stock is sufficient.
    5.  **Create Draft Order in CRM (`Complex Data Entry` / `Multi-Site Interaction`):**
        *   *Instruction:* "Log into the CRM at `[CRM URL]`. Create a new Sales Order. Enter the Customer Name and PO Number from the PO document. Add line items for each Item Code and Quantity from the PO, confirming stock was available."
        *   *Action:* Cura logs into the CRM and fills out the sales order form using data from Step 2 and confirmation from Step 3.
    6.  **Notification (`Simple Task` / `Reporting` aspect):**
        *   *Instruction:* "Send an email to 'sales-team@example.com' confirming that Sales Order draft for PO Number `[PO Number]` has been created in the CRM."
        *   *Action:* Cura sends a confirmation email.

*   **Outcome:** This workflow automates the entire process from receiving a PO document to having a draft sales order ready in the CRM, requiring manual intervention only if issues arise (like insufficient stock). It combines document reading, multi-site interaction, data entry, and notifications.
