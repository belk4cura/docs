"Deep Research" involves asking Cura to explore topics in-depth, gather information from multiple online sources, and potentially synthesize findings. Unlike [Simple Tasks](/use-cases/simple-tasks) which perform single actions, Deep Research acts like a research assistant, navigating sites, reading content, and following links to answer complex questions or explore broad subjects.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Exploration:** Goes beyond initial search results to explore linked pages and related sources.
*   **Multi-Source Information Gathering:** Collects relevant details from various websites or documents.
*   **Information Synthesis (Potential):** Can involve summarizing findings or extracting key points from the gathered information.
*   **Complex Questions:** Addresses questions that require understanding context and gathering diverse perspectives, not just finding a single fact.

**When to Use Cura for Deep Research:**

Ask Cura to perform Deep Research when you need to:

*   Understand a complex topic by gathering information from multiple viewpoints.
*   Perform market research on competitors, trends, or customer sentiment.
*   Investigate background information on a company, person, or event.
*   Compile information from various sources for a report or presentation (though Cura focuses on gathering; see [Report Generation](/use-cases/report-generation) for creating the report itself).
*   Explore potential solutions or approaches to a problem by researching different options online.

### Examples of Deep Research (Conceptual)

Hereâ€™s how Cura can function as your research assistant:

1.  **Competitive Analysis:**
    *   *Goal:* Understand how key competitors are positioning a specific product.
    *   *Instruction:* "Research how Competitor A, Competitor B, and Competitor C describe their 'Smart Widget' product on their websites. Summarize the main features they highlight and any pricing information you can find."
    *   *Action:* Cura visits the websites, navigates to the relevant product pages (even if the exact URL isn't known beforehand), reads the content, extracts the requested information, and provides a summary.

2.  **Exploring a New Technology Trend:**
    *   *Goal:* Get an overview of recent advancements in vertical farming.
    *   *Instruction:* "Find and summarize three recent articles or reports discussing new technologies or breakthroughs in vertical farming."
    *   *Action:* Cura searches for relevant content, identifies promising articles or reports, accesses them, reads through, and synthesizes the key findings into summaries.

3.  **Background Check on a Potential Partner:**
    *   *Goal:* Gather publicly available information about a company you might partner with.
    *   *Instruction:* "Research Company XYZ. Find information about their leadership team, recent news mentions, and primary business areas from their website and recent press releases or reputable news sources."
    *   *Action:* Cura explores the company's website, searches for news, identifies relevant pages or articles, and extracts the requested details.

These examples illustrate how Cura can tackle research tasks that require exploration and information gathering across the web, saving you hours of manual browsing and reading.
