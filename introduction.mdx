## What is Cura?

Cura is a browser-native AI agent (aka 'digital assistant') that performs complex tasks on behalf of users—from data entry and multi-site research to automation powered by videos and documents. It saves time, reduces manual effort, and unlocks new levels of productivity by letting AI work across the web like a real assistant.

## Why Cura

### Instead of building this myself?

Developing and deploying a reliable browser AI agent is fraught with complexities that demand significant technical resources and time. When you build it yourself, you must contend with challenges like:

*   Building robust backend servers.
*   Ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
*   Implementing real-time error correction.
*   Coordinating asynchronous task execution.
*   Managing secure, scalable hosting.
*   Constantly adapting to browser updates.
*   Enabling the agent to learn from its mistakes.

Together, these hurdles illustrate why in-house development not only diverts focus from your core business but also risks falling short of the precision and reliability that modern web automation demands.
