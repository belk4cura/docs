Welcome to the Curalabs API reference!

This section provides detailed information about our available API endpoints. You can use this API to interact programmatically with the Curalabs platform.

While you can interact with these endpoints directly, we strongly recommend using our official [Python SDK](/developer/sdk-setup) for most integrations. The SDK provides a convenient abstraction layer, handling authentication, request signing, and other complexities, allowing you to focus on implementing the core logic for tasks, workflows, and document management.

The following sections detail the raw API endpoints. If you prefer using the SDK, please refer to the [Developer Guides](/developer/overview).
