title: 'Task Update Notification (Webhook)'
---


This webhook notifies your configured URL when a task status changes to 'completed' or 'failed'. Your endpoint should receive a `POST` request with a JSON body.

**Important:** Security is handled via `X-Webhook-Timestamp` and `X-Webhook-Signature` headers, which must be verified by the webhook receiver using the API Secret. Refer to the SDK documentation for details on verification.

## Request Body

The `POST` request will contain a JSON body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event_type": "task.completed | task.failed",
  "data": {
    // TaskStatus Object
  }
}
```

### Properties

*   **`event_type`** (string, required): The type of event that occurred.
    *   Enum: `"task.completed"`, `"task.failed"`
    *   Example: `"task.completed"`
*   **`data`** (object, required): An object containing the details of the task status. This matches the `TaskStatus` schema defined in the main OpenAPI specification. See the [Get Task Status](./get.mdx) endpoint documentation for the `TaskStatus` schema details.

### Example Payload (`task.completed`)

```json
{
  "event_type": "task.completed",
  "data": {
    "task_id": "tsk_abc123xyz789",
    "status": "completed",
    "result": {
      "summary": "Task complete",
      "data": {}
     },
    "error": null,
    "created_at": "2025-04-13T23:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-04-13T23:05:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Responses

Your webhook endpoint should respond quickly with an HTTP `200 OK` status code to acknowledge successful receipt of the webhook. Any other status code may be interpreted as a failure by our system.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
