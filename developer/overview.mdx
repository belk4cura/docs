# Developer Documentation Overview

Welcome to the developer documentation. This section provides essential guides for integrating with our platform, primarily focusing on the use of our official Python SDK.

*   **[Managing API Keys](./managing-api-keys.md):** Learn how to generate and manage the API Key and Secret required to authenticate the SDK.
*   **[Python SDK Usage Guide](./python-sdk-usage.md):** Detailed instructions and examples on how to install, initialize, and use the Python SDK to initiate and manage browser automation tasks.

We strongly recommend using the Python SDK for all integrations, as it simplifies authentication and interaction with our platform.
