This guide explains how to use the official Python SDK to initiate and manage browser automation tasks for your end-users.

**Prerequisites:** Before using the methods described here, ensure you have:
1.  Followed the [Python SDK Setup](./sdk-setup.md) guide for installation and initialization.
2.  Obtained your credentials as described in [Managing API Keys](./managing-api-keys.md).
3.  Successfully initialized the `agent` object as shown in the SDK Setup guide.

## Starting an Automation Task

To initiate a browser automation task for one of your end-users, use the `start_task` method. You must provide the unique ID of the user within your system (`developer_user_id`) so our backend knows which user's extension to target.

```python
try:
    task_details = agent.start_task(
        developer_user_id="user-unique-id-in-your-system-123", # Required: Your internal ID for the end-user
        instructions="Log in to example.com with username 'testuser' and password 'password123', then navigate to the dashboard." # Required: Instructions for the agent
    )

    if task_details:
        task_id = task_details.get('task_id')
        print(f"Task successfully queued with ID: {task_id}")
        # Store task_id to check status later
    else:
        print("Failed to queue task.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while starting the task: {e}")

```python
try:
    task_details = agent.start_task(
        developer_user_id="user-unique-id-in-your-system-123", # Required: Your internal ID for the end-user
        instructions="Log in to example.com with username 'testuser' and password 'password123', then navigate to the dashboard." # Required: Instructions for the agent
        # target_url="https://example.com/login" # Optional: Specify a starting URL
    )

    if task_details:
        task_id = task_details.get('task_id')
        print(f"Task successfully queued with ID: {task_id}")
        # Store task_id to check status later
    else:
        print("Failed to queue task.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while starting the task: {e}")

```

The `start_task` method returns a dictionary containing the `task_id` and the initial status (usually 'queued') if successful, or `None` on error. It accepts the required `developer_user_id` and `instructions`.

It also accepts an **optional** `target_url` parameter (string or list of strings) to specify an exact starting page(s). If `target_url` is omitted, the agent will navigate based solely on the description provided in the `instructions`.

*For details on using `target_url` (including multiple URLs) versus instruction-based navigation, see [Advanced SDK Patterns: Using target_url](./advanced-sdk-patterns.md#using-targeturl-for-initial-context-optional).*

## Checking Task Status and Results (Polling)

You can periodically check the status of a task using its `task_id` with the `get_task_status` method.

```python
import time

task_id_to_check = "tsk_..." # Replace with the actual task ID obtained from start_task

if task_id_to_check:
    while True:
        try:
            status_info = agent.get_task_status(task_id_to_check)

            if not status_info:
                print("Failed to get task status.")
                break

            status = status_info.get('status')
            print(f"Current task status: {status}")

            if status in ['completed', 'failed']:
                print("Task finished.")
                print(f"Result: {status_info.get('result')}")
                print(f"Error: {status_info.get('error')}")
                break
            elif status in ['queued', 'processing']:
                # Wait before checking again
                print("Task still in progress, checking again in 10 seconds...")
                time.sleep(10)
            else:
                print(f"Unknown status: {status}")
                break

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while checking task status: {e}")
            break
else:
    print("No task ID provided to check status.")

```

The `get_task_status` method returns a dictionary containing the task's current `status`, `result` (if completed), and `error` (if failed), or `None` on error.

## Handling Results via Webhooks (Recommended)

Polling can be inefficient. We recommend configuring a webhook endpoint in your dashboard settings. When a task completes or fails, our system will send a `POST` request to your webhook URL with the task details.

Use the `verify_webhook` method in the SDK to securely verify that incoming webhook requests originated from our system before processing the payload.

```python
# Example using Flask framework - Adapt for your framework
from flask import Flask, request, abort
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/your-webhook-endpoint', methods=['POST']) # Replace with your actual endpoint
def handle_webhook():
    # Get signature and timestamp from headers (adjust header names if needed)
    signature = request.headers.get('X-Webhook-Signature')
    timestamp = request.headers.get('X-Webhook-Timestamp')

    if not signature or not timestamp:
         print("Missing signature or timestamp headers")
         abort(400)

    # Get the raw request body
    request_body = request.get_data()

    # Verify the signature using the SDK
    is_valid = agent.verify_webhook(
        request_body=request_body,
        signature_header=signature,
        timestamp_header=timestamp
    )

    if not is_valid:
        print("Invalid webhook signature.")
        abort(403) # Forbidden

    # Signature is valid, process the payload
    try:
        payload = json.loads(request_body)
        print("Received valid webhook:")
        print(json.dumps(payload, indent=2))

        # Add your logic here to handle the event (e.g., update your database, notify user)
        # event_type = payload.get('event_type')
        # task_data = payload.get('data', {})
        # task_id = task_data.get('task_id')
        # status = task_data.get('status')
        # result = task_data.get('result')
        # error = task_data.get('error')

    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Invalid JSON received in webhook body.")
        abort(400)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing webhook payload: {e}")
        abort(500)

    return "Webhook received successfully", 200

# Remember to run your web server (e.g., app.run())
```
Ensure your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible and configured correctly in your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting (Documentation Environment)

*Note: This section pertains to issues encountered while setting up the local documentation preview environment using the Mintlify CLI, not the Python SDK itself.*

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error (Mintlify CLI)">

    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
