# Managing API Keys

To interact with our API, you need an API Key and an associated API Secret. These credentials are used to authenticate your backend application when it makes requests to our system. Details on authentication are available in the main API reference or the Python SDK documentation.

You can manage your API keys within the **Developer Settings** (or similarly named section) of your dashboard.

## Generating a New API Key

1.  Navigate to the "API Keys" section within your dashboard settings.
2.  Click the "Generate New API Key" button.
3.  Optionally, provide a descriptive label for the key (e.g., "Production Backend", "Staging Server") to help you identify it later.
4.  Click "Generate".

The dashboard will display your new **API Key** (e.g., `pub_...`) and the associated **API Secret** (e.g., `sec_...`).

:::danger IMPORTANT
Your **API Secret** is shown **only once** immediately after generation. You **cannot retrieve it again**.

*   Copy the API Secret immediately and store it securely (e.g., in your environment variables, secrets manager).
*   Do **not** share your API Secret or commit it to version control.
*   Treat your API Secret like a password.

## Viewing Existing Keys

The "API Keys" section of your dashboard lists all your generated keys. For security reasons, only the public **API Key**, its description, creation date, and status are displayed. Secrets are never shown again after initial generation.

## Revoking an API Key

If an API key is compromised or no longer needed:

1.  Go to the "API Keys" section in your dashboard.
2.  Find the key you wish to revoke.
3.  Click the "Revoke" or "Delete" button associated with that key.
4.  Confirm the action.

Once revoked, the API key and its associated secret will no longer be valid for authenticating requests. Any applications using the revoked key will fail to connect to our API.
