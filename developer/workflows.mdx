This guide explains how to use the Python SDK to define, initiate, and monitor multi-step workflows.

**Prerequisites:** Before using the methods described here, ensure you have:
1.  Followed the [Python SDK Setup](./sdk-setup.md) guide for installation and initialization.
2.  Obtained your credentials as described in [Managing API Keys](./managing-api-keys.md).
3.  Successfully initialized the `agent` object as shown in the SDK Setup guide.

## Creating a Workflow Definition

Define a reusable sequence of tasks that can be executed later.

```python
import os
from curalabs_agent import cura # Assuming 'cura' is the client object

# Assume agent is initialized as shown in the Initialization section
# agent = cura(...)

workflow_tasks = [
    {"instructions": "Navigate to gmail.com and log in."},
    {"instructions": "Find the latest email from 'support@example.com'."},
    {"instructions": "Extract the subject line."}
]

try:
    workflow_def = agent.create_workflow(
        name="Check Support Email Subject", # Required: A user-friendly name
        tasks=workflow_tasks # Required: List of task steps (dictionaries with 'instructions' and optional 'target_url')
    )

    if workflow_def:
        workflow_id = workflow_def.get('workflow_id')
        print(f"Workflow definition created successfully with ID: {workflow_id}")
        # Store workflow_id for later use
    else:
        print("Failed to create workflow definition.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while creating the workflow definition: {e}")

```

The `create_workflow` method requires a `name` for the workflow and a list of `tasks`. Each item in the `tasks` list defines a step and **must contain either**:
*   An `instructions` string (which guides the agent's actions for that step). This may optionally be paired with a `target_url` (string or list of strings) to specify an exact starting page(s) for the step.
*   OR the `task_id` of a pre-defined task (like one generated from video).

You cannot provide both `instructions` and `task_id` for the same step.

The `target_url` within a task step definition is **optional**. If provided, it specifies the starting page(s) for that specific step. If omitted for a step, the agent will begin that step based on the context from the previous step or navigate based purely on the `instructions` provided for the current step.

*For more details on using `target_url` (including multiple URLs) versus instruction-based navigation within steps, see [Advanced SDK Patterns: Using target_url](./advanced-sdk-patterns.md#using-targeturl-for-initial-context-optional).*

**Example using `task_id`:**

```python
# Assume task_id_from_video was obtained from the video processing job
task_id_from_video = "tsk_xyz789abc123" 
standard_logout_task_id = "tsk_logout_task_def" # Assumes a predefined task for logging out

workflow_tasks_mixed = [
    {"task_id": task_id_from_video}, # Step 1: Run the task generated from video
    {"instructions": "Summarize the result obtained in the previous step and send it as an email."}, # Step 2: Use instructions
    {"task_id": standard_logout_task_id} # Step 3: Run a standard logout task
]

try:
    workflow_def_mixed = agent.create_workflow(
        name="Process Video Task and Summarize", 
        tasks=workflow_tasks_mixed 
    )
    if workflow_def_mixed:
        print(f"Workflow using task_id created: {workflow_def_mixed.get('workflow_id')}")
    else:
        print("Failed to create mixed workflow.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

On success, `create_workflow` returns a dictionary containing the details of the created workflow, including its unique `workflow_id`.

## Starting a Workflow Run

Initiate an execution run of a previously defined workflow for a specific end-user.

```python
workflow_id_to_run = "wf_..." # Replace with the actual workflow_id from create_workflow
user_id = "user-unique-id-in-your-system-456" # Replace with the end-user's ID in your system

try:
    start_response = agent.start_workflow_run(
        workflow_id=workflow_id_to_run, # Required: ID of the workflow to run
        developer_user_id=user_id # Required: Your internal ID for the end-user
    )

    if start_response:
        run_id = start_response.get('run_id')
        print(f"Workflow run successfully queued with Run ID: {run_id}")
        # Store run_id to check status later
    else:
        print("Failed to queue workflow run.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while starting the workflow run: {e}")

```

The `start_workflow_run` method requires the `workflow_id` of the definition to execute and the `developer_user_id` of the target end-user. On success, it returns a dictionary containing the unique `run_id` for this specific execution and its initial `status` (usually 'queued').

## Checking Workflow Run Status (Polling)

Monitor the progress and retrieve the results of a specific workflow run using its `run_id`.

```python
import time

run_id_to_check = "wfr_..." # Replace with the actual run_id obtained from start_workflow_run

if run_id_to_check:
    while True:
        try:
            status_info = agent.get_workflow_run_status(run_id_to_check) # Required: ID of the run

            if not status_info:
                print("Failed to get workflow run status.")
                break

            status = status_info.get('status')
            print(f"Current workflow run status: {status}")

            if status == 'completed':
                print("Workflow run completed.")
                print(f"Result: {status_info.get('result')}") # Result structure may vary
                break
            elif status == 'failed':
                print("Workflow run failed.")
                print(f"Error: {status_info.get('error')}")
                break
            elif status in ['queued', 'processing']:
                # Wait before checking again
                print("Workflow run still in progress, checking again in 10 seconds...")
                time.sleep(10)
            else:
                print(f"Unknown status: {status}")
                break

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while checking workflow run status: {e}")
            break
else:
    print("No Run ID provided to check status.")

```

The `get_workflow_run_status` method requires the `run_id`. It returns a dictionary containing the run's current `status`, `result` (if completed, structure may vary), `error` (if failed), and other details like `workflow_id` and timestamps, or `None` on error.

*(Note: Handling results via webhooks, similar to [tasks](./tasks.md#handling-results-via-webhooks-recommended), is also recommended for workflows to avoid polling. The webhook payload structure for workflow events would need to be defined and verified using `agent.verify_webhook`.)*
