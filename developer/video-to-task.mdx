This guide explains how to use the Python SDK to upload a video for automatic task generation and check the processing status.

**Prerequisites:** Before using the methods described here, ensure you have:
1.  Followed the [Python SDK Setup](./sdk-setup.md) guide for installation and initialization.
2.  Obtained your credentials as described in [Managing API Keys](./managing-api-keys.md).
3.  Successfully initialized the `agent` object as shown in the SDK Setup guide.

This feature allows you to generate a task definition by providing a video recording of the desired actions. The processing happens asynchronously.

## Uploading Video for Task Generation

Upload a video file and associate it with an end-user to start the task generation process.

```python
import os
from curalabs_agent import cura # Assuming 'cura' is the client object

# Assume agent is initialized as shown in the Initialization section
# agent = cura(...)

user_id = "user-unique-id-in-your-system-789" # Replace with the end-user's ID in your system
video_file_path = "path/to/your/screen_recording.mp4" # Path to the video file on your system
optional_task_name = "Task from Recording" # Optional: Provide a name

try:
    # Note: The SDK likely handles opening and sending the file content.
    # Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
    job_details = agent.create_task_from_video( # Updated method name
        developer_user_id=user_id, # Required: Your internal ID for the end-user
        file_path=video_file_path, # Required: Path to the video file
        task_name=optional_task_name # Optional: Name for the generated task
    )

    if job_details:
        job_id = job_details.get('job_id')
        print(f"Video upload accepted. Processing job started with ID: {job_id}")
        # Store job_id to check status later
    else:
        print("Failed to start video processing job.")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Video file not found at {video_file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while uploading the video: {e}")

```

The `create_task_from_video` method requires the `developer_user_id` and the `file_path` to the video. It's assumed the SDK handles reading the file content from the provided path. You can also provide an optional `task_name` for the generated task. On success, it returns a dictionary containing the `job_id` for this processing task and its initial `status` (usually 'queued').

## Checking Processing Job Status (Polling)

Monitor the status of the asynchronous video-to-task generation job using the `job_id`.

```python
import time

job_id_to_check = "vwp_..." # Replace with the actual job_id obtained previously

if job_id_to_check:
    while True:
        try:
            status_info = agent.get_task_processing_job_status(job_id_to_check) # Updated method name

            if not status_info:
                print("Failed to get video processing job status.")
                break

            status = status_info.get('status')
            print(f"Current job status: {status}")

            if status == 'completed':
                print("Video processing completed.")
                generated_task_id = status_info.get('task_id') # Updated field name
                print(f"Generated Task ID: {generated_task_id}")
                # You can now use this task_id
                break
            elif status == 'failed':
                print("Video processing failed.")
                print(f"Error: {status_info.get('error')}")
                break
            elif status in ['queued', 'processing']:
                # Wait before checking again
                print("Job still in progress, checking again in 15 seconds...")
                time.sleep(15) # Processing might take longer
            else:
                print(f"Unknown status: {status}")
                break

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while checking job status: {e}")
            break
else:
    print("No Job ID provided to check status.")

```

The `get_task_processing_job_status` method requires the `job_id`. It returns a dictionary containing the job's current `status`. If completed, it includes the `task_id` of the generated task definition. If failed, it includes an `error` message. It may also contain timestamps. Returns `None` on error.
