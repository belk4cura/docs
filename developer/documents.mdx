This guide explains how to use the Python SDK to upload documents (PDF, Word, images, etc.) associated with specific end-users.

**Prerequisites:** Before using the methods described here, ensure you have:
1.  Followed the [Python SDK Setup](./sdk-setup.md) guide for installation and initialization.
2.  Obtained your credentials as described in [Managing API Keys](./managing-api-keys.md).
3.  Successfully initialized the `agent` object as shown in the SDK Setup guide.

Uploaded documents can be used downstream by the platform or automation tasks/workflows.

## Uploading a Document

Upload a file from your system and associate it with one of your end-users using their `developer_user_id`.

```python
import os
from curalabs_agent import cura # Assuming 'cura' is the client object

# Assume agent is initialized as shown in the Initialization section
# agent = cura(...)

user_id = "user-unique-id-in-your-system-123" # Replace with the end-user's ID in your system
document_file_path = "path/to/your/report.pdf" # Path to the document file on your system
optional_document_name = "Q1 Report" # Optional: Provide a name, otherwise filename might be used

try:
    # Note: The SDK likely handles opening and sending the file content.
    # Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
    doc_details = agent.upload_document(
        developer_user_id=user_id, # Required: Your internal ID for the end-user
        file_path=document_file_path, # Required: Path to the document file
        document_name=optional_document_name # Optional: Name for the document
    )

    if doc_details:
        document_id = doc_details.get('document_id')
        filename = doc_details.get('filename')
        print(f"Document '{filename}' uploaded successfully with ID: {document_id}")
        # Store document_id if needed
    else:
        print("Failed to upload document.")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Document file not found at {document_file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while uploading the document: {e}")

```

The `upload_document` method requires the `developer_user_id` and the `file_path` to the document. It's assumed the SDK handles reading the file content from the provided path. You can also provide an optional `document_name`. On success, it returns a dictionary containing details about the uploaded document, including its unique `document_id` and the stored `filename`.
