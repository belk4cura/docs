The Curalabs Platform serves as your command center for managing Cura, the AI agent designed to automate your web-based tasks. Through the platform, you can:

*   **Execute Automations:** Initiate simple tasks or complex workflows ([Doing Tasks](/platform/doing-tasks)).
*   **Schedule Runs:** Set your automations to run automatically at specific times or intervals ([Scheduling Automations](/platform/scheduling-automations)).
*   **Define Workflows:** Create sophisticated, multi-step processes for Cura to follow ([Using Workflows](/platform/using-workflows)).
*   **Leverage Diverse Inputs:** Use video recordings ([Tasks from Videos](/platform/doing-tasks-from-videos)) or uploaded files ([Uploading Documents](/platform/uploading-documents)) to create or inform automations.
*   **Monitor and Manage:** Track agent activity ([Viewing Activity](/platform/activity)), manage usage ([Managing Credits](/platform/credits)), configure your workspace ([Managing Workspace](/platform/managing-workspace)), and understand security protocols ([Security & Safety](/platform/security)).

While the platform provides a user-friendly interface for managing Cura, developers can also integrate these powerful automation capabilities directly into their own applications. Our API and Python SDK allow programmatic control over task creation, workflow management, document handling, and more.
