Think of the Agent Scratchpad as Cura's digital notebook. It's a dedicated area within the platform where you can find:

*   **Automation Outputs:** The results or data extracted by Cura during its tasks and workflows.
*   **Generated Files:** Any reports, summaries, or other files Cura was instructed to create.
*   **Task Logs (Potentially):** Detailed logs or steps taken during an automation run might also be accessible here (linking to [Viewing Activity](/platform/activity) if appropriate).

This scratchpad provides a central location to review and retrieve the artifacts generated by Cura's work.

*(Detailed explanation of how to navigate and use the scratchpad features will be added here).*
