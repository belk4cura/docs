Want Cura to perform tasks automatically without you having to ask each time? You can schedule your automations (both individual Tasks and multi-step Workflows) to run at specific times or regular intervals. This is incredibly useful for monitoring information, ensuring tasks run consistently, and gathering data automatically.

**Why Schedule Automations?**

*   **Consistency:** Ensure routine tasks (like pulling reports or checking statuses) happen reliably on schedule.
*   **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on websites for changes (e.g., price updates, stock levels, specific content) by having Cura check regularly.
*   **Timeliness:** Gather data or perform actions at specific times (e.g., checking sales figures first thing in the morning).
*   **Efficiency:** Run tasks during off-hours or automatically trigger processes based on time rather than manual initiation.

**What Can Be Scheduled?**

You can typically schedule any reusable Task or Workflow you have defined, including those designed for:

*   **Simple data checks:** Checking a specific value on a page.
*   **Report data gathering:** Collecting figures needed for regular reports.
*   **Multi-site checks:** Comparing prices or checking statuses across different websites.
*   **System updates:** Running routine data entry tasks.

**How Scheduling Enables Monitoring & Alerting:**

By scheduling tasks to run repeatedly, you inherently create a monitoring system. For example:

*   **Price Monitoring:** Schedule a task to check a product's price on a competitor's website every day. If the task includes a step to notify you (e.g., send an email) *if* the price changes or drops below a certain threshold, you've created a price alert system.
*   **Inventory Checks:** Schedule a workflow to check stock levels for key items across supplier websites every morning. The result of the workflow run will tell you the current levels.
*   **Website Content Monitoring:** Schedule a task to visit a specific webpage and check if certain keywords appear or disappear, notifying you of changes.

The key is combining the **scheduling feature** with a **Task or Workflow** designed to check the desired information and potentially include a notification step based on the findings.

### Examples of Scheduled Automations (Conceptual)

1.  **Daily Price Check:**
    *   *Goal:* Monitor the price of a specific item daily.
    *   *Setup:* Create a `Simple Task` to visit a product page and extract the price. Add a step to email you if the price is below $50.
    *   *Schedule:* Run this task every day at 8:00 AM.

2.  **Weekly Report Data Collection:**
    *   *Goal:* Gather sales data for a weekly report automatically.
    *   *Setup:* Create a `Report Generation` workflow that logs into the sales dashboard and extracts key metrics.
    *   *Schedule:* Run this workflow every Monday at 6:00 AM so the data is ready for the weekly meeting.

3.  **Hourly Website Status Check:**
    *   *Goal:* Ensure a critical webpage is loading correctly.
    *   *Setup:* Create a `Simple Task` that just visits `[Your Website URL]` and checks for a specific element or text that should always be present. Include a step to notify IT via email if the check fails.
    *   *Schedule:* Run this task every hour.
